This is an example of how to write an basic application based on [ROC](https://github.com/rocjs/roc) and [roc-package-web-app-react](https://github.com/rocjs/roc-package-web-app-react).

To test this application you need to create a client at imgur.com.
`https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient`

Add the `client id` and `client secret` to `config/default.json`.
